# The Pythagorean Expectation

![Cover Image](pyth_mlb.jpg)

When we think about Data Analysis and sports, we immediately recall the great story of Billy Beane and his Oakland Athletics (Moneyball) ⚾️. His magic lay in realizing, through data analysis, that players capable of getting to first base were being undervalued. 📊

This brings me to another concept from the same sport: Pythagorean Expectation, proposed by Bill James. This formula is defined as the relationship between a team's winning percentage and the runs scored and allowed (in the case of baseball).

The Pythagorean expectation describes that in any season, the percentage of games won will be proportional to the square of total points scored by the team 📈 divided by the sum of total points scored by the team squared plus total points conceded by the team squared.

This is a concept which can help to explain not only why teams are successful but also can be used as the basis for predicting results in the future.
